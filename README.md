### Activity 1: Linear Regression

**Aim:**  
To learn to train a simple Linear Regression Model using Python.

**Activities Done:**  
- **Experience to Salary Prediction Model:**  
  Predicts salary based on years of experience using linear regression.  
  Dataset: [Kaggle Salary Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amineoumous/salary-data)

- **Chicago Taxi Trip Fare Prediction Model:**  
  Predicts taxi fare amounts from trip data using linear regression.  
  Dataset: [Kaggle Chicago Taxi Trips](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adelanseur/taxi-trips-chicago-2024)

### Activity 2: Logistic Regression

**Aim:**  
To understand and implement Logistic Regression models for binary and multiclass classification problems using Python.

**Activities Done:**  

- **Admission Predictor Model:**  
  Predicts graduate school admission based on GRE score, GPA, and undergraduate institution prestige using binary logistic regression.  
  Dataset: [UCLA Binary Logistic Regression Dataset](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/stata/dae/binary.dta)

- **Purchase Prediction Model:**  
  Predicts the category of product a customer is likely to purchase based on demographic and transactional features using multinomial logistic regression.  
  Dataset: [Kaggle - Retail Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)

### Activity 5: Support Vector Machines

**Aim:**  
To apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification for identifying patterns in datasets such as spam emails or quadratic relationships, and to evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

**Activities Done:**
- **Diabetes Classification:**  
  Predicted whether a person has **diabetes** based on medical features such as **Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age**.  
  Steps: preprocessing, train-test split, model training, tree visualization, accuracy & confusion matrix.  
  **Dataset:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) 

- **Email Spam Classification:**  
  Classified whether an email is **spam or not spam** based on features like **word frequencies (e.g., ‘the’, ‘to’, ‘and’, etc.)** and **message structure attributes**.  
  Steps: data exploration, feature-target separation, train-test split, model training with linear kernel, prediction, accuracy evaluation, and confusion matrix visualization.  
  **Dataset:** [Email Spam Classification Dataset CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv)

- **Quadratic Distribution Classification:**  
  Classified points as belonging to one of two classes based on a **quadratic boundary** defined by formulas like **x₁² + x₂² < threshold**.  
  Steps: generating random data points, labeling based on quadratic condition, train-test split, model training with polynomial kernel, prediction, accuracy evaluation, and decision boundary visualization.  
  **Dataset:** Synthetic dataset generated using Python (features: **x₁, x₂**, labels based on quadratic relationship).
